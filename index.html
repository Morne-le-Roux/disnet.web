            <h3>PICState</h3>
            <p>PICState was an internal job tracking system for a company I used to work for. Designed from the ground up using Flutter and Dart, it was a way for the company to track jobs and their progress. It was modified to add features like a Pricing Calculator for the sales team. It used Supabase as the backend.</p>

        <div class="personal-project-card">
            <h3>AbSentry</h3>
            <p>AbSentry was a freelancing app built for a middle school teacher. It was an app to track student's attendance and provide an excel spreadsheet of the data. Built with Flutter and Dart, with Firebase as the backend. </p>

            <h3>White Label Stock Keeping App</h3>
            <p>This is an unnamed app I built and sold to a few local small businesses. It is a simple app to help them manage their stock. Once bought, I rebranded the app to their liking and added their own logo. It is built with Flutter and Dart, with Supabase as the backend. For the future of this app, I am planning on combining this with the OrderUp app, and adding a point of sale system. Not for sale as a whitelabel app anymore, but to run as a SAAS.</p>

        <div class="personal-project-card">
            <h3>CAH Scoreboard</h3>
            <p>CAH Scoreboard is a simple app to help you keep track of the score in Cards Against Humanity. Mainly for personal use, as its a game we regularly play with friends. It has since been modified to include other games as well. It is built with Flutter and Dart.</p>

        <div class="personal-project-card">
            <h3>OrderUp</h3>
            <p>OrderUp was a freelancing app built for a school. They have an annual fair where they sell food and drinks. They needed an app to help their front of house staff stay in sync with what was left in stock. It was built with Flutter and Dart.</p>
